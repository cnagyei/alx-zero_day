# 0x03. Git

## Resources

- [Resources to learn Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
- [How to write a Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

- [Effective pull requests and other good practices for teams using GitHub](https://codeinthehole.com/tips/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/)

## General Requirements

- A `README.md` file at the root of the `alx-zero_day` repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. `0x03-git`), describing what this project is about
- **Do not use GitHub’s web UI**, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
- Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else

## Basic Usage

At the end of this project you should be able to reproduce and understand these command lines:

```sh
$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
```
